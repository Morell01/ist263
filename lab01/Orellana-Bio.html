        My name is Marlon Orellana, and I am a senior. I currently am in the Information Management & Technology major with concentrations in data analytics and project management. What interest in both concentrations is the vast information that can be gathered for sports and managing projects like those in construction. For hobbies and who I am outside of school. I enjoy watching soccer and my favorite team is Manchester United. I am bad at shows, but I currently watch House MD.I am Hispanic and a first generation student.
