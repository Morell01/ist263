            <h2>Building a Computer with Specific Budgets</h2>
            <p>Everyone has a specific budget that they are willing to spend on their new computer. This page provides an example of three budgets that one can use to navigate a potential budget that might pique their interest: $500, $1000, $1500. $500 is for the most budget consumer that wants to be able to play certain games but also able to do simple tasks as using Microsoft 365 apps. $1000 brings you to more power for video games at 1440p and in addition, users can do more intense tasks such as photo and video editing.</p>

            <h2>What to Consider</h2>
            <div>
            <p> A big thing to consider when building a computer is your budget. You should not overspend on computer parts that may or may not be needed; buy knowing what you exactly need. I am a big advocate of building your own computer cause you can more bang for your buck in terms of performance. Many prebuilt computers are either very expensive or not worth their price compared to their performance.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Another thing to consider is the operating system you will use. Many computers in the world use Windows or MacOS, but MacOS is not available for purchase and to install on PCs. Linux is another option as well and is open source, but there is many versions of it and the process is complex compared to installing Windows. Lastly, Windows 11 keys are expensive when you buy them in store, so I recommend looking online for a Windows CD key which is normally half the price. </p>
