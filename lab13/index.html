            <h1> Marlon Orellana's Biography  </h1>

            <p>
                My name is Marlon Orellana, and I am a senior. I currently am majoring in <strong>Information Management & Technology</strong> with concentrations in data analytics and project management.
                What interest in both concentrations is the vast information that can be gathered for sports and managing projects like those in construction.
            </p> 
            
            <h2> Personal Information</h2>
            <p> 
                For hobbies and who I am outside of school. I enjoy watching soccer and my favorite team is Manchester United. 
                I am bad at shows, but I currently watch House MD which is a medical show with an interesting main character (Dr.House), which makes the show stand out compared to others in the same genre.
            </p>
